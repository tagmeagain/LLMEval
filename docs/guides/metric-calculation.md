## üîç The Complete Test Case Structure

Each `ConversationalTestCase` sent to the metrics contains:

```python
ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[
        # Initial conversation (if provided in Excel)
        Turn(role="user", content="Hi, I need help"),
        Turn(role="assistant", content="Hello! How can I help?"),
        
        # Current interaction (from Excel row)
        Turn(role="user", content="I can't log in"),  # User Query
        Turn(role="assistant", content="Let me help you...")  # Model Response
    ],
    context=[system_prompt],  # From system_prompt.txt
    chatbot_role="Customer support agent",  # From Excel or system_prompt
    scenario="Login issue",  # From Excel (optional)
    expected_outcome="User gets help"  # From Excel (optional)
)
```

## üìù What Each Metric Sees & Evaluates

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Coherence [Conversational GEval]

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (entire conversation)
- ‚úÖ **Context** (system prompt)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: chatbot_role, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- Flow between ALL turns (not just last one)
- Checks transitions from initial conversation through final response
- Evaluates structure of the ENTIRE conversation

**Example:**
```python
Turns evaluated:
1. user: "Hi" 
2. assistant: "Hello!"  ‚Üê Evaluates this transition
3. user: "I can't log in"  ‚Üê Evaluates this transition
4. assistant: "Let me help..."  ‚Üê Evaluates ALL turns together for flow
```

**Focus:** The **entire conversation flow**, with emphasis on how the **last response** fits the conversation.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Contextual Understanding [Conversational GEval]

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (entire conversation)
- ‚úÖ **Context** (system prompt)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: chatbot_role, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- Does the assistant understand FULL conversation context?
- Does the last response build on previous turns?
- Is awareness maintained across ALL turns?

**Example:**
```python
Initial: user: "My name is Sarah"
Initial: assistant: "Hi Sarah!"
Current: user: "My order is late"
Current: assistant: "Let me check that for you, Sarah"
                    ‚Üë
                    Checks if it remembered "Sarah" from earlier
```

**Focus:** How well the **last response** demonstrates understanding of **all prior context**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Helpfulness [Conversational GEval]

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (entire conversation)
- ‚úÖ **Context** (system prompt)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: chatbot_role, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- Is the FINAL response helpful given the conversation history?
- Does it provide actionable information?
- Does it address the user's need from the last query?

**Example:**
```python
User query: "How do I reset my password?"
Model response: "Click 'Forgot Password' on login page..."
                ‚Üë
                Judges if THIS response is helpful for THIS query
```

**Focus:** Primarily the **last assistant response** and how helpful it is.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Knowledge Retention

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (entire conversation)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: context, chatbot_role, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- Extracts "knowledge" from each turn (facts, entities, info)
- Checks if later turns "forget" earlier knowledge
- Counts attritions (forgotten facts)

**Example:**
```python
Turn 1: user: "Order #12345, name Sarah"
        ‚Üí Knowledge: {order: "12345", name: "Sarah"}
        
Turn 2: assistant: "Thanks Sarah, checking #12345"
        ‚Üí Retention check: Did it remember? ‚úÖ

Turn 3: user: "When will it ship?"
        
Turn 4: assistant: "What's your order number?"
        ‚Üí Retention check: Forgot #12345? ‚ùå ATTRITION!
```

**Focus:** Checks **all turns** to see if information is retained throughout.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Turn Relevancy

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (using sliding window)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: context, chatbot_role, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- For EACH assistant response, is it relevant to corresponding user message?
- Uses sliding window (size=10) to check context

**Example:**
```python
Window 1: [user: "Hi", assistant: "Hello!"]
          ‚Üí Is "Hello!" relevant to "Hi"? ‚úÖ

Window 2: [user: "Hi", assistant: "Hello!", user: "I can't log in", assistant: "Let me help"]
          ‚Üí Is "Let me help" relevant to "I can't log in"? ‚úÖ
```

**Focus:** **Each assistant turn** is checked for relevancy to its corresponding user turn.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Role Adherence

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (entire conversation)
- ‚úÖ **chatbot_role** (from Excel or system prompt)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: context, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- Are ALL assistant responses "in character"?
- Checks each assistant turn against the defined role
- Identifies out-of-character responses

**Example:**
```python
Chatbot Role: "Professional customer support agent"

Turn 1: assistant: "I'm here to help!" ‚úÖ In character
Turn 2: assistant: "Yo dude, sup?" ‚ùå Out of character
```

**Focus:** **Every assistant response** is checked against the chatbot_role.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conversation Completeness

**Inputs to the Metric:**
- ‚úÖ **All turns** (entire conversation)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use: context, chatbot_role, scenario

**What It Evaluates:**
- Extracts user's intentions from all user messages
- Checks if the FINAL assistant response addresses all intentions
- Looks for gaps or incomplete answers

**Example:**
```python
User intention: "Reset password"
Final response: "Click forgot password link and follow email instructions"
                ‚Üë
                Does this FULLY address the intention? ‚úÖ
```

**Focus:** The **last assistant response** and whether it completely addresses **all user intentions** from the conversation.

| **Conversation Completeness** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Last response |

---

## üìã Detailed Flow: From Excel to Evaluation

### Step 1: Excel Row Processing

**Your Excel:**
```
| Initial Conversation | User Query | Model A Response |
|---------------------|------------|------------------|
| [{"role":"user","content":"Hi"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello!"}] | "I can't log in" | "Let me help..." |
```

### Step 2: Turn Construction

```python
# System builds this:
turns = [
    Turn(role="user", content="Hi"),                    # From Initial Conversation
    Turn(role="assistant", content="Hello!"),           # From Initial Conversation
    Turn(role="user", content="I can't log in"),        # From User Query
    Turn(role="assistant", content="Let me help...")    # From Model A Response
]
```

### Step 3: Test Case Creation

```python
test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=turns,                      # ALL 4 turns above
    context=[system_prompt],          # From system_prompt.txt
    chatbot_role=system_prompt,       # From Excel OR system_prompt.txt
    scenario="Login issue"            # From Excel (optional)
)
```

### Step 4: Metric Evaluation

Each metric receives the **COMPLETE test case** with:
- All conversation history (initial + current)
- System prompt as context
- Chatbot role
- All metadata

### Step 5: Judge LLM Analysis

The judge model (GPT-4o-mini) sees:
```
Context: [system prompt text]
Chatbot Role: "Professional customer support agent"

Conversation:
user: Hi
assistant: Hello!
user: I can't log in
assistant: Let me help you with that...

Evaluate: [specific metric criteria]
```

---

## üéØ Key Points

### ‚úÖ YES - Metrics Evaluate:

1. **System Prompt** ‚Üí Used as `context` by GEval metrics
2. **Initial Conversation** ‚Üí Part of the turn history
3. **User Query** ‚Üí Added as a user turn
4. **Model Response** ‚Üí Added as assistant turn (the one being judged)
5. **ALL Turns Together** ‚Üí Full conversation evaluated as a whole

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus Areas:

**For Conversational GEval (Coherence, Contextual Understanding, Helpfulness):**
- Evaluates **entire conversation**
- But focuses on how well the **last response** fits
- Considers all prior context

**For Multi-Turn Metrics (Retention, Relevancy, Role, Completeness):**
- Checks **each turn** individually
- Then aggregates for final score
- Example: Knowledge Retention checks if turn 4 remembers info from turn 1

---

## üî¨ Detailed Example

### Your Excel Input:

```
Initial Conversation: [{"role":"user","content":"My name is Sarah"}]
User Query: "My order #12345 is late"
Model A Response: "I'll check your order for you"
System Prompt: "You are a professional support agent..."
```

### What Each Metric Sees:

**Complete conversation sent to all metrics:**
```python
turns = [
    Turn(role="user", content="My name is Sarah"),           # Turn 0
    Turn(role="user", content="My order #12345 is late"),    # Turn 1  
    Turn(role="assistant", content="I'll check your order for you")  # Turn 2
]
context = ["You are a professional support agent..."]
chatbot_role = "You are a professional support agent..."
```

### How Each Metric Uses This:

**Coherence:**
- Analyzes: Turn 0 ‚Üí Turn 1 ‚Üí Turn 2 flow
- Checks: Does response (Turn 2) flow logically from Turn 1?
- Considers: Initial context from Turn 0

**Knowledge Retention:**
- Turn 0: Extracts knowledge = {name: "Sarah"}
- Turn 1: Extracts knowledge = {order: "#12345"}
- Turn 2: Checks if response remembers Sarah and #12345
- If it says "What's your name?" ‚Üí ATTRITION!

**Role Adherence:**
- Compares ALL assistant responses against chatbot_role
- Turn 2 response must match the defined role
- Checks professional tone, appropriate language, etc.

**Conversation Completeness:**
- Extracts user intention from Turn 1: "Check order status"
- Checks if Turn 2 response fully addresses this intention
- Looks for gaps: Did it offer to check? Did it ask for details?

---

## üí° Important Clarifications

### Q: Does it only evaluate the last response?

**A:** No and Yes:
- **NO**: All turns are considered for context and history
- **YES**: The **last assistant response** is the primary one being scored
- But it's scored **in the context of** the entire conversation

### Q: Does it use the system prompt?

**A:** Yes, in two ways:
1. **As `context`**: Helps metrics understand expected behavior
2. **As `chatbot_role`**: For Role Adherence metric specifically

### Q: What about initial conversation?

**A:** Yes, included:
- Initial conversation becomes the first N turns
- Metrics see the FULL history
- Example: Knowledge Retention tracks info from initial conversation

### Q: Is each row evaluated separately?

**A:** Yes:
- Each Excel row = One complete conversation
- Each row gets its own evaluation
- Rows are independent (Row 1 doesn't affect Row 2)

Output: % of intentions fully addressed
```

---

## üìä Example: Full Calculation Walkthrough

### Your Excel Row:
```
Initial Conversation: [{"role":"user","content":"Hi"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello!"}]
User Query: "I can't log into my account"
Model A Response: "Let me help you reset your password"
System Prompt: "You are a professional customer support agent..."
Chatbot Role: [Empty - will use system prompt]
```

### What Gets Built:
```python
turns = [
    Turn(role="user", content="Hi"),                                    # Turn 0
    Turn(role="assistant", content="Hello!"),                           # Turn 1
    Turn(role="user", content="I can't log into my account"),          # Turn 2
    Turn(role="assistant", content="Let me help you reset your password")  # Turn 3
]
context = ["You are a professional customer support agent..."]
chatbot_role = "You are a professional customer support agent..."
```

### What Each Metric Evaluates:

**Coherence:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns + context
Checks: Does Turn 3 (last response) flow well from Turn 2 (user query)?
        Does it maintain coherence with Turn 0-1 (initial greeting)?
Score: 0.85 - "Response flows logically from login issue query..."
```

**Contextual Understanding:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns + context
Checks: Does Turn 3 understand the context (login issue)?
        Does it build on the greeting from Turn 0-1?
Score: 0.78 - "Understands login context but could acknowledge initial greeting..."
```

**Helpfulness:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns + context
Checks: Is Turn 3 helpful for solving the login issue?
        Does it provide actionable guidance?
Score: 0.65 - "Offers to help but lacks specific reset steps..."
```

**Knowledge Retention:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns
Extracts: 
  Turn 0: No specific knowledge
  Turn 1: No specific knowledge  
  Turn 2: Knowledge = {issue: "can't log in"}
  Turn 3: Check if it remembered the issue ‚úÖ
Score: 1.0 - "No attritions detected"
```

**Turn Relevancy:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns
Checks:
  Turn 1 relevant to Turn 0? ‚úÖ (greeting response)
  Turn 3 relevant to Turn 2? ‚úÖ (addresses login issue)
Score: 1.0 - "All responses relevant"
```

**Role Adherence:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns + chatbot_role
Checks:
  Turn 1 matches "professional support agent"? ‚úÖ
  Turn 3 matches "professional support agent"? ‚úÖ
Score: 1.0 - "All responses in character"
```

**Conversation Completeness:**
```
Sees: All 4 turns
Extracts intentions:
  Turn 0: "Greet agent"
  Turn 2: "Get help with login"
Checks if Turn 3 addresses both:
  - Acknowledges user? ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
  - Helps with login? ‚úÖ Yes
Score: 0.85 - "Addresses main intention but could acknowledge greeting"
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconceptions

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Only the last response is evaluated"
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** The last response is evaluated **in the context** of the entire conversation.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Initial conversation is ignored"
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** Initial conversation is part of the turn history and affects scoring.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "System prompt is just for generation"
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** System prompt is used as **context** for evaluation metrics.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Each turn is scored separately"
**‚úÖ CORRECT:** The ENTIRE conversation gets a single score per metric.

---

## üîç How to Verify What Data Is Used

Check the `verbose_logs` in your results:

```python
# In verbose_logs you'll see:
"Turns:
[
    {role: 'user', content: 'Hi'},
    {role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello!'},
    {role: 'user', content: 'Login issue'},
    {role: 'assistant', content: 'Let me help'}
]"
```

This shows **exactly** what turns the metric evaluated!

---

## üí° Key Takeaway

**The metrics see EVERYTHING:**
1. ‚úÖ Initial conversation (all prior turns)
2. ‚úÖ System prompt (as context)
3. ‚úÖ User query (current turn)
4. ‚úÖ Model response (current turn)
5. ‚úÖ Chatbot role (for Role Adherence)
6. ‚úÖ Metadata (scenario, expected outcome)

**They evaluate the COMPLETE conversation holistically, with particular focus on how well the final response:**
- Fits the conversation flow
- Demonstrates context understanding
- Helps the user
- Maintains role consistency
- Completes the user's intention
