# Excel Input Format Guide

## üìã Overview

Your input Excel file can be in **two formats** depending on your testing mode:

1. **Prerecorded Mode** - Test existing responses
2. **Generate Mode** - Generate responses on-the-fly

---

## üìä Format 1: Prerecorded Mode (Recommended)

### When to Use:
- You have responses already collected
- Testing existing chatbot outputs
- Comparing logged conversations
- Faster evaluation (no API calls to models)

### Required Columns:

| Column Name | Required? | Description | Example |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Initial Conversation** | Optional | Previous conversation context in JSON format | `[]` or `[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello!"}]` |
| **User Query** | ‚úÖ Required | The user's current message | `"I can't log into my account"` |
| **Model A Response** | ‚úÖ Required | Base model's response | `"Let me help you with that"` |
| **Model B Response** | ‚úÖ Required | Fine-tuned model's response | `"Oh no! Let me help you reset your password"` |
| **Chatbot Role** | Optional | Role for metrics (uses system_prompt.txt if empty) | `"Customer support agent"` |
| **Scenario** | Optional | Test scenario description | `"Login issue"` |
| **Expected Outcome** | Optional | What should happen | `"User gets help resetting password"` |

### ‚úÖ Excel Example (Prerecorded Mode):

```
| Initial Conversation | User Query | Model A Response | Model B Response | Chatbot Role |
|---------------------|------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| [] | How do I reset my password? | You can reset your password by clicking forgot password. | Oh no! Let me help you. Just click 'Forgot Password' and you'll get an email with instructions. Super easy! | Customer support agent |
| [{"role":"user","content":"Hi"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello!"}] | My order is late | Your order delay has been noted. | So sorry to hear that! Let me quickly check the tracking for you. | Customer support agent |
```

### How to Create This Excel:

**Option 1: Manual Entry in Excel**
1. Open Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets
2. Create headers in Row 1
3. Add your data starting from Row 2

**Option 2: Create from CSV**
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Initial Conversation': ['[]', '[]'],
    'User Query': ['How do I reset password?', 'My order is late'],
    'Model A Response': ['Click forgot password', 'Delay noted. Provide order number.'],
    'Model B Response': ['Let me help! Click Forgot Password...', 'Oh no! Let me check that...'],
    'Chatbot Role': ['Customer support agent', 'Customer support agent']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_excel('input/my_test.xlsx', index=False)
```

---

## üìä Format 2: Generate Mode

### When to Use:
- You want models to generate responses live
- Testing new scenarios
- Don't have pre-collected responses
- Want real-time model comparison

### Required Columns:

| Column Name | Required? | Description | Example |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Initial Conversation** | Optional | Previous conversation context in JSON format | `[]` or `[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]` |
| **User Query** | ‚úÖ Required | The user's current message | `"I can't log into my account"` |
| **Chatbot Role** | Optional | Role for metrics | `"Customer support agent"` |
| **Scenario** | Optional | Test scenario | `"Login issue"` |

### ‚ùå Do NOT Include:
- ~~Model A Response~~
- ~~Model B Response~~

(These will be generated automatically)

### ‚úÖ Excel Example (Generate Mode):

```
| Initial Conversation | User Query | Chatbot Role | Scenario |
|---------------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| [] | How do I reset my password? | Customer support agent | Password reset |
| [{"role":"user","content":"Hi"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello!"}] | My order is late | Customer support agent | Order tracking |
```

---

## üìù Initial Conversation Format

The **Initial Conversation** column should contain JSON array of previous turns.

### Empty (No Prior Context):
```
[]
```

### Single Prior Exchange:
```json
[
  {"role":"user","content":"Hi, I need help"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"Hello! Happy to assist you."}
]
```

### Multiple Prior Exchanges:
```json
[
  {"role":"user","content":"Hi"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"Hello!"},
  {"role":"user","content":"I have a question"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"Sure, what would you like to know?"}
]
```

### Tips:
- Use **double quotes** in JSON (not single quotes)
- Must be **valid JSON** format
- Can have any number of prior turns
- Only include `user` and `assistant` roles

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå WRONG: Invalid JSON
```
Initial Conversation: {'role':'user','content':'Hi'}
```
**Problem:** Single quotes not valid in JSON  
**Fix:** Use double quotes: `{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}`

### ‚ùå WRONG: Missing brackets
```
Initial Conversation: {"role":"user","content":"Hi"}
```
**Problem:** Should be an array  
**Fix:** Add brackets: `[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]`

### ‚ùå WRONG: Missing columns
```
Just has: User Query, Model A Response
Missing: Model B Response
```
**Problem:** Prerecorded mode needs both responses  
**Fix:** Add Model B Response column OR use generate mode

### ‚ùå WRONG: Wrong column names
```
user_query, modelA_response
```
**Problem:** Case-sensitive, needs exact names  
**Fix:** Use: `User Query`, `Model A Response`

## üìÅ File Location

Save your Excel files in:
```
DeepEval/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ input/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_test.xlsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another_test.xlsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ queries.xlsx
```

## üöÄ After Creating Excel

Run evaluation:
```bash
# Prerecorded mode
python evaluate.py input/your_test.xlsx

# Generate mode (auto-detected)

```

The system will:
1. Auto-detect mode (based on columns)
2. Evaluate all 8 metrics including **Human Tonality**
